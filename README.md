# Increase in shark attacks in Pernambuco-BR and its relationship with works at the port of Suape.
# Project status(Active)

# Project objective
### The objective of the project was to analyze the increase in cases of shark attacks in Pernambuco compared to the most symbolic works carried out in the 90's in the port of Suape. As a basis for scientific provocation I used the materials described below and as proof of the works I leave together the website of the port of Suape. 
I used the dataset found at: https://www.sharkattackfile.net/incidentlog.htm 

Suape port maintenance history:https://www.suape.pe.gov.br/pt/institucional/historico-de-suape.

Newspaper: https://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/brasil/2023/03/5078325-ataques-de-tubarao-entenda-porque-recife-e-um-local-com-muitos-casos.html

## Steps:
### The project is fully described step by step.
Clearing the data/
Importing the libraries for visualizations and analysis/
Exploring the raw data/
Functions used in the process/
Performing cleaning, substitutions and withdrawals from the original DataFrame/
Analyzing and comparing the cases of attacks in the coastal states of Brazil in relation to Pernambuco/
Defining and exploring the new DataFrame/
To continue the study, I will eliminate columns and without relevance/
Comparison between attacks in the world and attacks in Brazil from 1990 to 2023/
Comparison of the number of attacks in Pernambuco compared to Brazil/
Graphics analysis

## Conclusion:
Based on the analyzes carried out, we assume a relative increase in cases of attacks from the 1990s onwards. In addition to this unfutable hypothesis, I leave the following points to be considered below: The database used is international, and closer follow-up may be restricted. I need the cases, in view of the likely graphic feed based on cases that are reported in the international press. Understanding the limitation of the data, since the start date of records starts in the 80's very close to the date of works that this study proposes to analyze. There is a need for more robust and local data to complement the analysis.

My first project \o/ I'm very happy, here's a message for Pedro from the future: Man, look how far you've come since the beginning! Do not stop!
I hope I helped someone with this project as many people helped me! Hugs to you who read!
