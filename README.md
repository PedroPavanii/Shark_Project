# Increase in shark attacks in Pernambuco-BR and its relationship with works at the port of Suape.
# Project status(Active)

# Project objective
### The objective of the project was to analyze the increase in cases of shark attacks in Pernambuco compared to the most symbolic works carried out in the 90's in the port of Suape. As a basis for scientific provocation I used the materials described below and as proof of the works I leave together the website of the port of Suape. 
I used the dataset found at: https://www.sharkattackfile.net/incidentlog.htm 

Suape port maintenance history:https://www.suape.pe.gov.br/pt/institucional/historico-de-suape.

Newspaper: https://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/brasil/2023/03/5078325-ataques-de-tubarao-entenda-porque-recife-e-um-local-com-muitos-casos.html

Methods:
Filtering
Grouping
Visualization

Technologies:
Python

Matplotlib
The project is fully described step by step.

Steps:
Clearing the data
Importing the libraries for visualizations and analysis:
Exploring the raw data:
Functions used in the process:
Performing cleaning, substitutions and withdrawals from the original DataFrame:
Analyzing and comparing the cases of attacks in the coastal states of Brazil in relation to Pernambuco:
Defining and exploring the new DataFrame:
To continue the study, I will eliminate columns and without relevance:
Comparison between attacks in the world and attacks in Brazil from 1826 to 2023:
Comparison of the number of attacks in Pernambuco compared to Brazil:
Graphics analysis:

Conclusion:
The database provides us with 95% of cases only registered in the 90's, thus limiting the understanding of the increase in cases related to port maintenance. The need for more robust and local data to complement the analysis is imposed.

My first project \o/ I'm very happy, here's a message for Pedro from the future: Man, look how far you've come! Don't stop!
I hope I helped someone with this project as many people helped me! Hugs to you who read!
